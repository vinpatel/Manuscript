Question: Why is it impossible to monitor both a particle 's position and momentum at the same time ? I am trying to familiarize myself with basic physics and can not get past this , do n't want to move forward until I understand it . Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: You 've heard particles are like waves right ? While it 's not the full story , lets consider them as waves for now . Now , think of a particle with a momentum as a ripple in a pond . Is the wave in one place ? No , in fact , it can spread out an incredibly large distance ! So then how do we ever get particles that look like they 're in one place ? Well , waves can interact with each other . More specifically , they can combine to become even bigger waves , or cancel each other out to become smaller or even nothing . You can try to picture this in your head , but remember the details do n't matter for this explanation . Just wrap your head around the fact that they CAN do this for some combination of waves . So you have your original wave . We can add a second wave to it that cancels it out , but only in some places . There are now two waves , but that combine to form wave takes up less space then either one . We can add more and more . Until we have all of these waves that happen to add up to just one tiny area being the only one that moves . That is now a particle acting like a particle . It now has one position . But what are all these waves we 're adding ? Each wave corresponds to a momentum the particle can have ! So , you can have many waves ( momenta ) combine to make a single small area ( one position ) , or you can have one wave ( one momentum ) and have it spread over a large area ( many position ) . You can also have any combination in between . But you CANNOT have both . Ever . For any reason . It 's NOT because of the way we measure them . It is the fundamental structure of the particle . It is how the universe works regardless of whether we are looking at it or not !
