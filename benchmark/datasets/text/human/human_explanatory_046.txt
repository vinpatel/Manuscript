Question: The Simulation Argument . Here is the original [ simulation argument ] ( URL_0 ) by Nick Bostrom . I am hoping someone can help clear it up . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: When smart people around us look at the universe , they can make some guesses about how much stuff is out there , how many planets are close to suns like ours and may be able to support life , and how many of those planets may have an advanced civilization . People also make some guesses that someday computers are going to be powerful enough to not only emulate a human brain , but also emulate an entire universe with a bunch of people in it . For the first one , the number of potential advanced civilizations out there is generally though to be pretty small ( after all , we have n't found any yet ) . But , the number of people here on Earth is pretty large and if you assume that computer power will eventually get to the point where running a simulation of the universe is possible , then the number of people running simulations could be pretty large . It could even be to the point where it 's like playing the Sims , only the characters in the game are self aware and think it 's real . So in summary ... Some people think the number of advanced civilizations out there is pretty small , but if any advanced civilization manages to create computers that can model the universe ( which they see as almost inevitable ) then the number of ' fake ' universes would be really big . Because of this , they say it 's far more likely that we 're living in a fake universe than the real one .
