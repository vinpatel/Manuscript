Question: Dark Matter What is it ? How does it work ? Why ca n't we directly affect it ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: So the Big Bang was a thing . The usual model is some dots on a balloon being blown up , and that 's going to work pretty well for us here . When the Big Bang started , there was some initial velocity , some initial spreading rate , some rate we expect the guy to be blowing up the balloon at { we have some idea of this rate due to [ CMBR ] ( URL_1 ) } . The dots on the balloon represent all the stuff ( AKA matter ) that we can see ; planets , stars , galaxies , grapefruits . All of these have mass and therefore gravity and pull each other together , like if someone put a bunch of rubber bands around the side of the balloon , pulling all of the dots , and also the space itself closer together . { this is where the big crunch idea comes in , that gravity will eventually beat the big bang and the universe will start shrinking back into a dot } But we can also look around and see how fast the universe is actually still expanding , and it 's going way too fast . { we know this due to the [ redshifts of observable galaxies ] ( URL_0 ) } There are n't nearly enough rubber bands on the balloon . We ca n't see any more stuff , but there must be : there is some matter out there ( actually a huge amount of it , like 10x more than normal matter ) and it 's dark , and that 's almost all we know about it . We know it has gravitational pulls , and we 're pretty sure it does n't interact with electromagnetism ( aka light ) and that makes it pretty hard for us and it to interact . { also , it 's been a while since I 've done much cosmology and I feel like I have this the wrong way round and this is closer to the reasoning for dark energy , I 'd welcome some fact checkers }
