Question: How is water managed and supplied in Trains ? You can use well explained technical terms and please talk about normal trains that are used for daily commute not the rather hi - tech ones ! Explain like I'm five. 

Answer: Sure! In most trains, water is stored in tanks located either underneath the train or in the roof. These tanks are filled up at train stations, either by attaching a hose to a water source or by using a tanker truck to transfer the water.\n\nInside the train, the water is then pumped through a series of pipes to different parts of the train, such as the toilets, sinks, and kitchen. Toilet water is treated with chemicals to help break down and flush away waste.\n\nTrains also have filters to remove any dirt or debris from the water before it is used. Some trains even have water purification systems to make sure the water is clean and safe to drink.\n\nOverall, the goal of the water management system in a train is to make sure there is enough clean water available for passengers to use during their journey.
