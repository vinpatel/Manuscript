Question: How were the first video games programmed ? Like on the atari and NES ? Were they coded or what ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: I think both earlier answers are not really ELI5 , so i 'll try : Computers work using 0 's and 1 's and they save a few of those numbers in * registers * ( slots in the memory ) . By putting a few 0 's and 1 's in one ' slot ' , you can represent a number like 23 or something . One can say ' use that register and add the value stored in there to a value stored another register . Put the result in another register ' . So now , you can add , subtract , basically do simple math . But that 's not the trick in programming . The trick to programming is ' asking ' if certain things are true of not . A programmer can say " is this register bigger than the other ? if that 's true , the program has to continue doing this . if not , than the program must do another thing " . Things you can ask are like ' are they equal ' , ' are they higer / lower than a certain number ' etc . Doing this a lot of times will eventually result in a program that can do quite a lot . Fun fact : Even rollercoaster tycoon was initaly build using this type of programming ( heck of a job ! )
