Question: Why do we have Decembers that get 70 degree weather but do n't have 30 degree Julys ? For reference I live in Northern Virginia and we get all four seasons . Last year we had a normal winter with sub 40 degree weather the entire time . Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: The weather in any given location is determined by a combination of factors, including the temperature of the air, the humidity of the air, the amount of sunshine and cloud cover, and the wind. These factors can be influenced by the movement of air masses, the rotation of the Earth, and the position of the Earth in its orbit around the sun.In the winter, the Earth is tilted away from the sun, which means that the Northern Hemisphere gets less direct sunlight. This can cause the air temperature to drop, especially at higher latitudes like Northern Virginia. In addition, the air tends to be dryer in the winter, which can make it feel colder than it actually is.In the summer, the Earth is tilted towards the sun, which means that the Northern Hemisphere gets more direct sunlight. This can cause the air temperature to rise, especially at higher latitudes like Northern Virginia. In addition, the air tends to be more humid in the summer, which can make it feel warmer than it actually is.So, in short, the reason why you might get warm weather in December and not in July is because of the position of the Earth in its orbit around the sun and the effect this has on the amount of direct sunlight the Northern Hemisphere receives.
