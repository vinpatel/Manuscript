Answer: Banks were created to provide a safe place for people to keep their money and to make it easier for people to borrow money. When people deposit money into a bank, the bank keeps the money safe and uses it to make loans to other people. The bank charges interest on the loans, which is how the bank makes money. Banks also make money by charging fees for services like using an ATM or having a checking account. Banks can also make money by investing the money they have in things like stocks or bonds. Banks are owned by shareholders, who are people or groups of people who own stock in the bank. The shareholders make money when the bank makes a profit. It's possible for there to be new banks because people may want to start a new business and decide to create a bank. Banks can also be created by governments to provide financial services to the public. Countries can be in debt when they borrow money from other countries or organizations. The country then has to pay back the loan with interest. Countries may also be in debt because they are spending more money than they are making. In this case, the country may have to borrow money to pay for its expenses.
