Question: Is using magnetism as an energy source possible ? I would really like to know more about magnets correlation to power generation . If you know about the subject , I would love to know about the idea of infinite energy and perpetual motion . ELI~10 . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: Magnets are used in power generation all the time . ( I 'm simplifying a lot of things here b / c of this subreddit ) When you pass a wire between two poles of a magnet , a current is induced . When you do this over and over , you get a flow of current , which can be used to run things . One way to do it over and over again is you could get a ring magnet , and get someone or something to rotate a coil of wire in between . This is the basic principle in electricity generation . In windmills , wind is used to rotate the coil . In dams , water is used to turn a turbine containing this stuff . In coal and gas , and nuclear plants ; coal , gas or nuclear reactions respectively are used to generate heat , which heat a huge vat of water to generate high pressure steam , which turns turbines , generation electricity . Infinite energy is impossible because you can not get more energy from any action . e.g. People like windmills because the work of turning the turbines comes from the wind . Basically , the work is done for free and is done cleanly . On the other hand , in coal plants , the work is provided by burning coal , which is nasty stuff .
