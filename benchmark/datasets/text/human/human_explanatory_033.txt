Question: Fourth and Fifth dimensional space After spending a bit of time drifting around the internet , I came across the magiccube 4d and 5d . I 'm utterly confused about how the 4d and 5d space works . A bit of help would be appreciated . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: The best way is to start from an analogy to the 2D and 3D world . Take a piece of paper and draw four arrows like this : ^ | < – – – + – – – > | v These arrows define two directions ( up - down and left - right ) . Now we want to find a way to move around while having the same distance from the four heads of the arrows . This is impossible to do on paper – however you move , one or two of the heads will be farther than the others . But in our 3D world we can start from the center of the cross and stay * above * the piece of paper . We have defined a new dimension ( above - below ) , the third one . Let 's imagine that a 2D picture starts leaving the piece of paper and climbs up the third dimension . It will become a flat figure in a 3D world and it will have zero width . It can leave the sheet of paper in different ways : It can leave it all at once , or it can start rotating until only a line of it ( a 1D figure ! ) is still on the paper . Now , we 'd like to add a fourth dimension to our 3D world . So if you have six arrows like [ this ] ( URL_3 ) , you 'd want to find a way to be at the same distance from the six heads . I have trouble visualizing that , but we 'll consider the analogy with the 2D example . There would be a fourth direction we could use to leave our 3D world . We could leave it all at once , disappearing completely from the view of the other people , or we could start rotating in 4D , until only a 2D figure of us lies in this world – we would look flat to the eyes of the others . What about 4D cubes ? Again , by analogy . We can construct a 3D cube stacking up a lot of squares ( which are 2D cubes in fact ) . But we 'll be stacking them along the third dimension , the one that these 2D cubes do not possess . In the same way , a 4D creature would construct a 4D cube stacking up 3D cubes along the fourth dimension . How does a 4D cube appear to us ? Let 's consider another question : How does a 3D cube appear on a piece of paper ? If you project a rotating cube on the paper ( analogy : you want to see its shadow on the paper ) you will get [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . So , the projection ( the " shadow " ) of a rotating 4D cube on our 3D world would be [ this ] ( URL_1 ) . One last mind - blowing thing : Do you remember how you used to construct a 3D cube cutting a figure like this : + – – – + | | + – – – + – – – + – – – + – – – + | | | | | + – – – + – – – + – – – + – – – + | | + – – – + from a sheet of paper and gluing its edges ? We can do the same thing with 3D cubes to get a 4D cube . [ This ] ( URL_2 ) is the 3D figure you 'd have to start from , and you 'll need to move the cubes into the 4th dimension and glue some of their sides together . We can infer how to construct the 5D space and 5D cubes in the same way , but it 's even less visualizable . We 'd need to stop using intuition and learn the right mathematical tools to deal with objects of any dimensions . The basic idea is simple : we need three coordinates to identify a place in a 3D world ( latitude , longitude and altitude ; or just up - down , left - right , above - below ) , that means only 3 numbers are needed . In a 4D world , we will use four ; in a 157D space , we will need 157 . Every action I 've described before can be translated into operations with groups of 4 numbers , or groups of 157 numbers . But this is no longer ELI5 .
