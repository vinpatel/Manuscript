Question: ELI8 : ( question from an actual eight - year - old ) how do we know how hot the sun is ? My kid would like to know . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: That 's a great question that took surprisingly long into the history of physics to figure out ! I 'll skip the historical details ( [ although you should read about it here ] ( URL_0 ) ) and cut to the chase : It turns out that everything with a non - zero temperature emits light all the time . This is n't necessarily the type of light that your eyes can detect , but it 's there all the same . It was discovered experimentally long before it was explained theoretically ( it took until the year 1900 ) , but now we have a pretty good understanding of what 's happening inside things when they glow . In fact , it 's the same reason that a hot object in a fire will begin to glow red , and why fire itself is orange at the top . This radiation is called Blackbody Radiation , named so because the form of the radiation is derived by assuming that the body is completely black , i.e. , it absorbs all incoming light and does n't scatter or reflect any . The only light that is emitted is actually generated inside the object , not just reflected from a nearby flashlight . The useful thing about blackbody radiation is that the spectrum of light that 's emitted is determined by the temperature and nothing else . That means that we can measure the spectrum of emitted blackbody radiation from an object and immediately know its temperature . There are some caveats though ; some materials do n't play by the rules , instead choosing to emit light that 's not well - described by the blackbody radiation spectrum . Luckily for us , the sun is one of the most ideal blackbody radiators that we 've discovered : that means our estimate of the temperature ( on the surface anyway ) is really quite accurate .
