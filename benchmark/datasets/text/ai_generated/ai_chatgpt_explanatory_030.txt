Question: how does a home equity loan work ? And how long after buying a house or condo do you typically have to wait to get one ? Explain like I'm five. 

Answer: A home equity loan is a loan that you can get using your home as collateral. This means that if you don't pay back the loan, the lender can take your home away from you.\n\nTo get a home equity loan, you need to have equity in your home. Equity is the difference between the value of your home and how much you still owe on your mortgage. For example, if your home is worth $200,000 and you still owe $100,000 on your mortgage, you have $100,000 in equity.\n\nTo get a home equity loan, you would typically have to apply with a lender and provide some information about your home and your finances. The lender will then decide whether to give you the loan based on your equity and your ability to pay it back.\n\nThere is no specific time that you have to wait after buying a house or condo to get a home equity loan. However, it's generally easier to get a home equity loan if you have owned your home for a while and have built up a lot of equity. This is because lenders are more likely to trust that you'll be able to pay back the loan if you've been paying your mortgage on time and have a lot of equity in your home.
