Question: Is voting a right , responsibility , or an option ? What are the differences between voting as a right , a responsibility , and an option ? ? And what are the implications behinds these ideas ? Explain like I'm five. 

Answer: Many people seem to think of the " right " to vote in very absolutist terms but the fact is the permission to vote has been a variable concept in the U.S. Women , native Americans , Blacks , etc . very much late arrivals on the voting scene ; there have always been restrictions on who can vote and * none * of us are allowed to vote for president even today . The " responsibility " to vote has never been taken as seriously in this country as it has in many others . Our % of those allowed to vote who actually do is low ; in midterm and special elections it is really a rather small number of citizens who choose our government . It is the function of our government to define who has the " option " to vote . The concept of a representative democracy was historically those groups of people who were permitted to vote ( men , property owners , plus whomever ) simply voted ; you showed up and voted and there was no big deal . In the U.S. there has been a tradition to be very restrictive * within * the permitted groups , with the current trend to " papers please " being a pretty natural evolution of style .
