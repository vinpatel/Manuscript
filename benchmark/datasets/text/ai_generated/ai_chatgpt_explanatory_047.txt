Answer: Sure! Wall Street is a street in New York City that is home to many financial companies, such as banks and investment firms. These companies help people and businesses manage their money and make investments to try to earn more money.

Occupy Wall Street was a movement that started in 2011. A group of people decided to protest and hold demonstrations on Wall Street to show their anger and frustration with the way that some financial companies were behaving. They believed that these companies were not acting in the best interests of ordinary people and were causing problems for the economy. The protesters camped out on Wall Street and held marches and rallies to try to bring attention to their cause.
