Question: How does my body " burn " calories to make food into energy ? I get what a calorie is , but how does my body use a small amount of food that we measure by its energy content into actual energy ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: Not sure how detailed you want it , because the details are complex biochemical processes and may not make much sense if you do n't have any chemistry knowledge . Essentially , carbohydrates , fats and protein are converted to their single units ( monomers ) , and then small biochemical changes are made to these monomers which generate ATP ( a form of stored energy in the body ) . Three basic processes make up the generation of ATP in cellular respiration : glycolysis , the krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation ( which requires oxygen ) . The type of food consumed determines where this chain of events starts . Glucose for example undergoes glycolysis resulting in the generation of 2 molecules of pyruvate , which then enters the krebs cycle ( in prescence of oxygen ) then undergoes oxidative phosphorylation . Fatty acids enter the krebs cycle directly , as does protein ( in the form of deaminated amino acids ) albeit at a different step of the krebs cycle . The main ATP producing stage is oxidative phosphorylation ( although glycolysis and the krebs cycle do produce ATP as well ) . During the krebs cycle a lot of reduced NAD is generated , and this is used during oxidative phos . During oxidative phosphorylation , electrons are transferred from electron donors ( reduced NAD ) to electron acceptors such as oxygen , in redox reactions . These redox reactions release energy , which is used to form ATP from a molecule of ADP and organic phosphate . ATP contains a high energy bond , and contains 3 phosphate groups . When this bond is broken to form ADP ( 2 phosphate groups ) , energy is released and this energy can then be utilised as required .
