Question: Why is x/0 undefined while 0/0 is undetermined ? What 's the difference between the two anyway ? Are n't both inapplicable ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: The first thing to note is that we can never divide by 0 . So both of these expressions are undefined , technically . However , in the context of limits ( I 'll explain in a second ) when things look like they 're going to x/0 or 0/0 we do different things . To start , a limit is simply explained as what does a function look like its doing as we get close to a point . We typically introduce limits by picking points closer and closer to a value and see where these results looks like they 're going . So , we want to know what 's going on around x = 1 of the function ( x^2 - 1)/(x-1 ) . We try to plug in x = 1 but we quickly realize that we see 0/0 . So we pick the point 0.9 and plug it in then 0.99 and 0.999 and numbers closer and closer to 1 . Then we point 1.1 and 1.01 and 1.001 and number closer and closer to 1 from the other direction and get this table x f(x ) 0.9 1.9 0.99 1.99 0.999 1.999 1 0/0 ? ? ? 1.001 2.001 1.01 2.01 1.1 2.1 and we can easily see that in this case 0/0 meant 2 . In another case : ( x^2 + x - 6)/(x^2 - x -2 ) as we get close to 2 . Well , plugging in x = 2 gives us 0/0 again . But a table analysis like above will tell use that this is really 1.666 Yet another case : ( e^x -x -1)/x^2 as x gets close to 0 . Plugging in 0 tells us 0/0 . But a table analysis ( taking a limit ) tells us 0.5 So 0/0 can really mean anything ! ---- Alternatively , let 's look at things that end up as x/0 . First example is ( x^2 ) /(x-2 ) as we get closer to 2 . We try to plug in 2 and we get 4/0 . Let 's do a table : x f(x ) 1.9 -36.1 1.99 -396.01 1.999 -3996 Things are going way off to negative infinity ! Let 's try the other direction : x f(x ) 2.1 44.1 2.01 404.01 2.001 4004 Things are going way off to the positive infinity ! Okay ... maybe it was a fluke . Let 's try another limit of the form x/0 : say ... 2/(e^x -1 ) as we get close to x=0 . Plugging in x = 0 tells us 2/0 . Right form . But building a table gives us infinities again ! So , we can see from a few examples here that x/0 means infinities , while 0/0 can mean anything . So , we call one of them undefined ( or really infinite ) and the other we call indeterminate because it can be anything , we just do n't know what . ( There are advanced ways of determining the " what " without building a table , but this should convey the point . ) ---- But really , what does all this mean ? Why do we care about limits ? Well , limits are the foundation for modern calculus . They can explain how rockets fly , how fireworks explode , nuclear reactors , electrical circuits , and many many more things . ---- TL;DR : This deals with the calculus topics of limits . Which is the question " what happens when we get close to _ _ _ _ _ " . And if it looks like x/0 then we get an infinity ( undefined ) and if looks like 0/0 we can get anything ( undetermined ) .
