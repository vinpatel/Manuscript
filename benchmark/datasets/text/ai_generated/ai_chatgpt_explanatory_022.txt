Question: How were the first video games programmed ? Like on the atari and NES ? Were they coded or what ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: The first video games were programmed using computer code, which is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. To create a video game, a programmer would write a program using a programming language, such as C or Assembly, and then use that program to tell the computer how to display the game on the screen and how to respond to the player's input.

On early systems like the Atari and NES, the programming was done using a special type of computer called a microprocessor. The programmer would write the code using a computer and then transfer it to the microprocessor using a special device called a ROM burner. The ROM burner would write the code onto a ROM (read-only memory) chip, which could then be inserted into the video game console.

Once the ROM chip was inserted into the console, the player could start the game by turning on the console and selecting the game from a list of available options. The console would then run the code on the ROM chip, following the instructions to display the game and respond to the player's input.

I hope that helps to explain how video games were programmed on early systems like the Atari and NES. Do you have any other questions about this topic?
