Question: What are the pros and cons of " always online " as it applies to video games ? Just wondering if there 's a silver lining to the feature that everyone seems to hate . Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: "Always online" refers to a feature in some video games that requires the player to have an active internet connection in order to play the game. This means that the player cannot play the game if their internet connection is not working. There are both pros and cons to this feature. Pros: Allows for multiplayer gameplay: One of the main advantages of "always online" is that it enables multiplayer gameplay. This means that players can compete or cooperate with each other in real-time over the internet.
Facilitates updates and patching: Another benefit of "always online" is that it allows developers to easily patch and update the game. This means that they can fix bugs, add new features, and make other improvements to the game without requiring the player to manually download and install updates. Cons: Requires a stable internet connection: The main disadvantage of "always online" is that it requires the player to have a stable internet connection in order to play the game. If the player's internet connection is unstable or goes down, they will not be able to play the game.
May have latency issues: Another potential issue with "always online" is that the game may experience latency, or delays in communication between the player's device and the game server. This can negatively affect the gameplay experience.
May require a subscription or microtransactions: Some "always online" games may also require a subscription or microtransactions in order to access certain content or features. This can be frustrating for players who do not want to pay extra for these things. Overall, "always online" has both benefits and drawbacks. It allows for multiplayer gameplay and easy updates, but also requires a stable internet connection and may have latency issues or require additional payments.
