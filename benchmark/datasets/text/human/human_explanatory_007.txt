Question: How forums detect whether you 're still online or not ? You 've all stumbled on the forums that have a little online check box thing under the usernames . How do the forum sites detect whether they 're currently online ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: /u / daniu is right . Most forums detect that way . But , some of them detect by keeping a constant connection between browser and the server . It works something like that : * When the page loads , page(client side , your browser ) sends a request with your credentials to server . Eg . * " Give me the page URL_0 , I 'm suername here is my info " * * Server ( the website , specifically imonline.php page ) does n't respond but does n't terminate the request either . It allows a connection between your pc and the server . Your browser waits until you get a request or timeout . If the your browser thinks that it takes too long ( timeout ) for that request , it terminates the request . If that happens , page sends another request right away . * While your have active connection , server knows that you are online . If you leave the page , request got terminated and therefore server knows you are offline . Most of the time , they do n't tag you offline the moment you lose active connection , they wait X seconds before tagging you offline . Also many chat scripts use this method . Facebook used to use a similar thing back then .
