Question: How does an anarcho - socialist society prevent a resurgence of capitalism , and how does an anarchist society in general prevent crime ? To me anarchy seems like a good idea in theory but has fundamental problems with implementation . Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: An anarcho-socialist society is one in which there is no government or state to enforce laws, but instead, the community is organized to meet the needs of all its members and make decisions collectively. This type of society is based on the idea that people can work together and cooperate without the need for a centralized authority. To prevent a resurgence of capitalism in an anarcho-socialist society, it would be important to challenge the idea that profit and private ownership are necessary for society to function. Instead, resources and decision-making would be controlled by the community as a whole, rather than by a small group of individuals. To prevent crime in an anarchist society, it would be important to focus on addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty, inequality, and social injustice. Instead of relying on punishment and incarceration, an anarchist society might try to solve problems through education, restorative justice, and community-based approaches to conflict resolution. It is important to note that no society is perfect, and there will always be challenges to overcome. However, an anarchist society is based on the idea that people can work together and solve problems without relying on a central authority or hierarchy. This requires trust, cooperation, and a willingness to work together towards common goals.
