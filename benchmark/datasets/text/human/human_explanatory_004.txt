Question: Why do we have Decembers that get 70 degree weather but do n't have 30 degree Julys ? For reference I live in Northern Virginia and we get all four seasons . Last year we had a normal winter with sub 40 degree weather the entire time . Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Nothing posted thusfar is an actual answer . The real reason is humidity , or the moisture content of the air . Forget relative humidity altogether for this explanation . In fact forget it for all discussions : relative humidity has no human value . What we need to consider is absolute humidity , or the actual weight of water vapor in the air . Dewpoint is the best indicator of this that you can find in a normal weather reading . Dewpoint is a nonlinear measure of absolute humidity . To see this , follow the [ 100 % relative humidity line on this graph ] ( URL_0 ) . What you will notice is cold air holds hardly any water , regardless of the relative humidity . This is important because it takes a lot more energy to warm up water vapor . Therefore air with a lot of moisture in it has a more stable temperature . It also takes additional energy to condense water out of the air , so temperature never falls below the dewpoint . The end result is it is very difficult for the temperature to fall dramatically in the summer , as the dewpoint is almost always 50 or higher in the summer . But in the winter , the dewpoint is extremely low . With very little moisture in the air , the temperature is free to swing much more wildly . This means it is easier to warm up , but also easier to cool down . This is why it can be 40 degrees above average , or just as easily 40 degrees below average . Normally in the winter melting snow stops the rapid warmup ( as melting takes a lot of energy ) . Right now there is no snow on the ground , so the temperature is free to rise .
