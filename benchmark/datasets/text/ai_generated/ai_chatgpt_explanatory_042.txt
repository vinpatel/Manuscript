Question: When I see a spark of electricity , what am I seeing ? Is it the air boiling ? Simple , please , Electricity is not my strong point Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Sure! When you see a spark of electricity, what you're seeing is actually a discharge of electricity. This happens when there is a build-up of electrical charge in a particular location, and the excess energy needs to be released. The spark that you see is the result of this discharge of electricity. It is caused by the movement of electrons, which are tiny particles that carry electrical charge. When the electrons move, they can create a bright light and sometimes even a loud noise. The spark that you see can happen in a variety of ways, but one common way is when there is a gap or a break in an electrical circuit. When this happens, the electrical charge can jump across the gap, creating a spark. This is called an "arc," and it is often seen when two pieces of metal are brought close together. So, to sum it up, when you see a spark of electricity, you are seeing a discharge of electrical energy. It is caused by the movement of electrons, and it can happen in a variety of ways, such as when there is a break in an electrical circuit. Does that help?
