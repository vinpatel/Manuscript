Question: When I see a spark of electricity , what am I seeing ? Is it the air boiling ? Simple , please , Electricity is not my strong point Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: To clarify a bit : yes , you 're seeing plasma . What 's happening is that when there 's enough buildup of charge to overcome the ( pretty darned high ) insulative properties of air , all of a sudden a huge rush of electrons surges through the cloud of air molecules . It does this so hard it basically rips a bunch of other electrons off of those air molecules . But , like anything , doing that takes energy . Just like it take energy to pull two magnets apart , it takes energy to pull an electron away from the nucleus of its atom . That 's fine , but it leaves the air in an unstable state : there are now a bunch of negatively charged electrons nearby a bunch of positively charged ions . It 's just like if you imagine suspending a bunch of magnets in a cloud in space or something : they would quickly attract one another and slam back together . The free electrons and the ions recombine back into electrically neutral atoms . When they do so , the electrons * give back * the energy they gained when they were pulled off of those atoms to begin with . This energy is emitted as photons of light , which is what you 're seeing .
