Question: Why nobody likes Piers Morgan . Apart from him being a Southerner . That 's just a disability some English people have to live with . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: I wonder how many people know his history ? Here in England he was editor of the Daily Mirror , which is the labour supporting tabloid . That is , the newspaper is the one with a readership which is more like democratic than republican , also including trade union support . But it is a tabloid too and not very political . Piers Morgan made a huge mistake editing the Daily Mirror , just after the Abu Graib photos had been published showing American prison guards humiliating Iraqi prisoners , Morgan 's paper received a lot of sensational photos . They were fake , but Morgan decided to publish them ; he got fired . To restart his career , he moved to America and became a different type of journalist . But one has to understand , his single motive is to get viewers by saying whatever he thinks is going to generate most publicity . Being a tabloid editor is a sort of cynical job , and his current job is likely one he views cynically too . Another press guy who migrated to America was Alistair Cambpbell . He did something a lot worse than get tricked into pubishing fake photos of abuse . Campbell intentionally published false intelligence which was used / believed by people like Colin Powell , and he was instrumental in doing things that led both countries into war . Campbell was a PR person , a press expert . One sometimes wonders , does the ' real person ' inside ever come out with these journalists and PR guys .
