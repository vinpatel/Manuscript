Question: how does a home equity loan work ? And how long after buying a house or condo do you typically have to wait to get one ? Explain like I'm five. 

Answer: You can think of equity as what would end up in your pocket if you sold your house and paid back your mortgage today . Suppose you just bought your house yesterday for 200k with a 20 % ( 40k ) down payment . If you sold it now , you 'd probably get the same price . Now you have 200k , but you need to pay off the rest of your mortgage ( 160k ) and you 're left with 40k in your pocket . That 's your equity , though in this case it 's really just money you already had before you used it to make the down payment . Now suppose you bought your house 29 years ago for 100k on a 30 - year mortgage . There is only 3k left on your mortgage . If you sold your house now for 200k , you 'd end up with 197k in your pocket , so your equity in that situation is 197k . Some of that equity came from the fact that you now pretty much own an expensive asset ( your house ) and some came from the fact that the asset appreciated in value since the time you paid for it . A home equity loan then is essentially a promise to sell your house and give the proceeds to the bank . In return for making that promise , the bank gives you money now . You do n't ultimately * have * to pay the bank back by selling your home . If you won the lottery or something , that money 's just as good . However , the reason the bank is willing to loan you the money is because they know that if all else fails , you can sell your house to pay them back .
