Question: ELI8 : ( question from an actual eight - year - old ) how do we know how hot the sun is ? My kid would like to know . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: The sun is really hot! We can't go near it because it would be too dangerous. But we have ways to measure how hot it is from far away.

One way we measure the temperature of the sun is by using special instruments on telescopes. These instruments can measure the heat coming from the sun and tell us how hot it is.

Another way we measure the temperature of the sun is by looking at the light it gives off. Different things give off different colors of light, and the color of the light can tell us how hot it is. For example, a piece of metal that is very hot will give off a reddish color of light. The sun gives off a yellow color of light, which tells us that it is very hot!

We also know that the sun is hot because it gives off heat and light that we can feel and see here on Earth. We can feel the heat from the sun on our skin when we go outside on a sunny day, and we can see the light from the sun in the sky. All of these things help us know that the sun is really hot!
