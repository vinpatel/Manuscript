Question: What benefits are there to dilluting US federal power and emplowering US state governments ? I have asked people the following question and did n't receive any real explanation or what the pros and cons are . I started wondering if I just do n't understand well enough . Explain like I'm five. 

Answer: There are several potential benefits to diluting federal power and empowering state governments:\n\nDecentralization: By giving states more power, decision-making can be more closely aligned with the needs and desires of local communities, rather than being dictated from the top-down by the federal government.\n\nExperimentation: States can serve as "laboratories of democracy," where different policies can be tried out and the best ones can be scaled up or replicated in other states.\n\nResponsiveness: State governments are often closer to the people and more responsive to their needs and concerns than the federal government, which can be more distant and bureaucratic.\n\nFlexibility: States can tailor their policies and programs to meet the specific needs of their citizens, rather than being forced to adhere to a one-size-fits-all approach dictated by the federal government.\n\nFederalism: The system of federalism, where power is shared between the federal government and the states, can provide a balance of power and help prevent any one level of government from becoming too dominant.\n\nThere are also potential downsides to diluting federal power and empowering state governments, such as:\n\nInequality: States have different levels of resources and may not be able to provide the same level of services to their citizens. This can lead to disparities in access to education, healthcare, and other important resources.\n\nConflicting policies: States may have different policies on issues such as immigration, healthcare, and gun control, which can lead to confusion and conflict for citizens who live in different states.\n\nLack of consistency: Without the oversight of the federal government, states may have inconsistent or conflicting policies, which can create confusion and make it harder for people to understand their rights and responsibilities.\n\nLimited impact: State governments may not have the same level of resources or influence as the federal government, which can limit their ability to address certain problems or achieve their goals.
