Question: ohms law I 'm getting into coil building for vapes and everyone says I need to understand ohms law and all I really know about it is how to spell it and it has something to do with resistance Explain like I'm five.

Answer: You need to look a bit beyond Ohm 's Law ( V = I R ) in to Power , because Power is what will determine the performance of the coil . Power is the rate energy is being used , per second , which will determine how much vaporisation gets done per second . Say you take apart an existing vaper and do some measurements . You have the battery voltage and the resistance of the coil . From those you can get a rough power usage figure for the coil in watts , using the formula P = V^2 / R. Now say you want to double the power for some reason - I 'm not going to ask why . That formula has certain implications : You could half the resistance , and the power usage would double . But if you doubled the voltage , the power usage would * quadruple * , because it 's related to the * square * of the voltage . So you would n't do that , you 'd increase it by a factor of about 1.4 ( the square root of 2 ) . This is ignoring questions about the performance of the coil itself , which other posters have touched on . In my opinion , more voltage over the same coil would overheat it , so increasing the voltage would mean you 'd have to increase the length of the coil wire too .
