Question: What are the pros and cons of " always online " as it applies to video games ? Just wondering if there 's a silver lining to the feature that everyone seems to hate . Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Pros : * It enables developers to make games that would n't be possible otherwise , where being online and interacting with other people is a fundamental part of the experience . This is how MMOs work , they simply would n't be the same game if you could play it offline . * Related to the previous point , it helps prevent cheating . If it were possible to play an MMO in an offline mode , it would be hard to tell if you cheated while you were offline . And since it 's a multiplayer game , that would spoil it for other people . So instead much of the game logic related to gaining XP and the like is handled by the server . * ( From the publishers ' point of view ) It helps prevent piracy . The game " phones home " so the publisher can verify you have a legit copy . This is most effective when the previous points apply too . If online functionality is only used for a few minor gameplay features ( if any at all ) , then someone will find a way to disable them and the online check . Cons : * Some people do n't have access to the Internet all the time , or they have an unreliable connection . So they might not really be able to play the game at all . * The publisher needs to run a lot of servers to keep the game up and running . They often break or ca n't keep up with demand , especially when the game has just come out and there 's a sudden surge of users . * The game will not last forever . Once the publisher decides to pull the plug , the game is effectively gone forever , and no one can ever play it again ( at least not legally ) .
