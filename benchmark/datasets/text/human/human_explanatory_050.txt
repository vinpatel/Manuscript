Question: Binary search algorithm I ca n't understand this at all . ELI5 ? Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: A binary search only works when the items that you 're searching for are sorted . Let 's imagine an example : There is a bookshelf with thousands of books , and the only thing you know about them is that they 're in alphabetic order by title . So say you want to find * To Kill a Mockingbird * . You start by looking at the very middle book . Is it * To Kill a Mockingbird * ? Nope , it 's * Pride and Prejudice * . So you know that the book you 're looking for is in the half of the shelf to your right . So now you pick the middle book of the right half of the shelf . Is it * To Kill a Mockingbird * ? Nope , it 's * War and Peace * , so you 've gone too far , and the book you want is somewhere between the center of the entire shelf , and the center of the right half of the shelf . So next you look in the center that * that * area . You keep repeating this until you find your book ( or discover that the book is n't there ) . This is an example of a recursive algorithm . Which is to say , you start by applying a binary search to the entire shelf . If you do n't find what you 're looking for , you apply a binary search to one half of the shelf . And then to half of that , and then to half of that , over and over until you either find what you 're looking for , or the " half " that you 're looking at only has one item , and it 's not the one you want .
