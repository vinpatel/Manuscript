Question: What gives art its value ? What s stopping me from painting a blue square and selling it for thousands ? obviously i 'd get zilch but proper artists can get away with it ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: While the quality of the art plays a factor in the value of the art itself , The back story of the art also plays a very important role in it 's valuation . Like /u / idamnedit mentioned , > Hitlers art was worthless , so he killed a couple people and tried taking over the world and boom his art becomes valuable . The Mona Lisa was n't worth shit . It gets stolen and recovered and boom it is valuable . Here 's a simple thought game . If someone like you or I made " a blue square " and tried to sell it , It 's quite obvious that we wo n't get anything meaningful . One the other hand , if someone famous , someone who is n't generally associated with art , someone like Bill Gates paints " a blue square " and sells it off for charity , there will be people queued up to buy it . It 's simple supply and demand . Paintings made by ordinary people like you or I is a dime a dozen whereas paintings that are rare and exclusive perhaps due to it 's back story or due to the artist who made is much more valuable .
