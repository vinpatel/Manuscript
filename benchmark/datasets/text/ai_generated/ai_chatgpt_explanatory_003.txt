Answer: The standard paper size of 8.5 by 11 inches is used in the United States and many other countries around the world. There are actually several different standard paper sizes that are used around the world, and they are all based on a system called ISO 216. This system sets out standardized paper sizes based on a series of ratios, so that if you fold a sheet of paper in half, the resulting sheet will have the same ratio of width to height as the original sheet. 
The standard size of 8.5 by 11 inches is known as "letter size" paper, and it is probably the most commonly used size in the United States. It is called "letter size" because it is the size of paper that is most commonly used for writing letters. It is also the size of paper that is used for printing documents like resumes, reports, and other business documents. 
The reason why this size is used so widely is that it is a convenient size for many different types of documents and it is easy to store and handle. It is also a good size for printing documents on home printers, which are often designed to handle this size of paper. 
So, to sum it up, the standard paper size of 8.5 by 11 inches is used because it is a convenient size for many different types of documents and it is easy to store and handle. It is also the size of paper that is most commonly used in the United States and many other countries around the world.
