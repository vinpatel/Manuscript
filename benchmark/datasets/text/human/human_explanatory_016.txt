Question: Why communism is such a bad thing ? In theory it seems logical that everyone getting the same amount of money is a good thing . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: A famous saying among communists was this : " From each one according to their ability , to each one according to their need . " This is not " everybody gets the same amount of money , " because it recognizes that some will need more than others , and thus should get more . But to answer the question : 20th century communist nations were , in practice , what 's called [ command economies ] ( URL_0 ) . This means that the central government made the important economic decisions : how much crops to grow , how many cars to build , how many workers to assign to crops vs. cars , etc . The USA and other Western nations in contrast have a * free market economy * : the government does n't decide these things , but rather the farmers and carmakers decide how much crops to grow and how many cars to build , based on what the consumers will buy and at what price . So the problem with command economies is that they do n't work . The most infamous example [ the famine in communist China ] ( URL_1 ) , where the government planned the agricultural economy wrong and as a result , the country in some cases did not grow enough food , and it others it did not send it to the people who needed it most .
