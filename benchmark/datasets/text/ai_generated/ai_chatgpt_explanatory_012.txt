Question: If traditional locks are easily picked , why do we still use them ? What are the great advantages of tradicional locks over other designs ? Security does n't seem that great ... Explain like I'm five. 

Answer: Traditional locks, also known as mechanical locks, are still widely used because they are relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and easy to repair. While it is true that some traditional locks can be picked, it is not a simple task and requires a certain level of skill and specialized tools. Most traditional locks provide a reasonable level of security for everyday use.\n\nThere are many different types of traditional locks, and some are more secure than others. For example, a deadbolt lock is a type of traditional lock that is more secure than a simple doorknob lock because it has a bolt that extends into the door frame, making it more difficult to force open.\n\nOne of the main advantages of traditional locks is that they do not rely on electricity or batteries, so they will continue to work even if there is a power outage. This can be important in an emergency situation.\n\nOverall, traditional locks are a reliable and cost-effective option for securing doors and windows in homes and businesses. While they may not offer the highest level of security, they can still provide a reasonable level of protection against most threats.
