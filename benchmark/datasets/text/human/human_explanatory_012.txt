Answer: It falls under one of four objectives in reduction of crime : [ increasing the perceived effort of crime . ] ( URL_0 ) Most petty crimes are crimes of opportunity , aka : easy to get away with and little risk involved . If you have a padlock on your shed a thief needs to pick it before you or your neighbor glance out the window and see him doing it . If there was no lock to mess with the thief could go right in and take what he wanted in a matter of seconds . Funny story , I lived in a house awhile back , and the bank was selling the house next door . There was a metal shed in the back . After awhile the Realtor sign said " sold . " A few days later I saw some guy in the neighboring house 's backyard with a big white pickup , disassembling the shed and putting it into the back of the truck . It took him about three days to do this . At the time I thought he was just working for the Realtor cleaning up the place . About a week later the man who bought the house yelled at us demanding to know why we did n't call the police on the man who stole his shed .
