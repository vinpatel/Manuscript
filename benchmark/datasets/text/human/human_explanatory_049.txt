Question: The Unit Circle and why it 's important Never truly understood it . Thanks ! Explain like I'm five.

Answer: This is hard to explain in words , but basically , the unit circle is there to simplify the math . Imagine that we want to calculate the sine of 30 degrees . You could take any old right triangle with side lengths that you know and calculate the sine by dividing the opposite side of that 30 degree angle by the hypotenuse . But if you drew that triangle so it 's hypotenuse had a length of 1 , you would n't have to do that division at all . Then , the sine would just be the length of the opposite side . That 's what happens on the unit circle . If you draw a right triangle between the origin , any point on the unit circle , and the point on the X - axis directly above or below that point , that right triangle will have a hypotenuse of 1 ( since the unit circle has a radius of 1 ) . So if you draw such a triangle and you want to find the sine of the angle between the hypotenuse and the X - axis , you will see that the length of the opposite side is just the Y - value of the point on the unit circle you picked . Same with the cosine , that 's the X - value . And same with the tangent , that 's X / Y. Hope that helps , I 'm not so great at math , lol .
