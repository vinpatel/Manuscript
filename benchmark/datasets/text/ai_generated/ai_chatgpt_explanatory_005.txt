Answer: Hair is made up of a protein called keratin. It grows on different parts of your body, including your head, face, arms, and legs. Hair has several purposes. For one, it helps keep your head warm and protects your scalp from the sun. On your face, hair helps keep your face warm and can also protect your eyes from dust and sweat. Hair also has a role in how we look and feel. Some people like to style their hair in different ways, like by braiding it or dying it different colors. Hair can also be a way for people to express themselves and show their personality. For example, someone might choose to wear their hair in a certain way to show that they're confident or rebellious. Finally, hair helps us to look and feel clean. When we wash our hair, it helps remove dirt, sweat, and oil from our scalp. This can help keep our hair healthy and looking nice. I hope that helps explain what hair is and what it does!
