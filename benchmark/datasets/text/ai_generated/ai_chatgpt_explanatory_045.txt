Question: What 's the big deal about Vulkan API ? From what I understand it is one of the Graphics APIs analogous to OpenGL or DirectX. Why was there a need for another one and how does it actually change things for developers or consumers ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics and compute API. It is designed to give developers more control over the hardware and more direct access to it, which can lead to better performance and more efficient use of resources.One of the main differences between Vulkan and other graphics APIs, such as OpenGL and DirectX, is that Vulkan is a "low-level" API. This means that it provides more direct access to the hardware and requires more work from the developer to use it effectively. This can make it more complex to use, but it also gives developers more control and can lead to more efficient and high-performance applications.Vulkan is designed to be more efficient and easier to use on a wide range of platforms, including desktop computers, mobile devices, and game consoles. It is also designed to be more adaptable to different hardware configurations, so it can be used on a wide range of devices.Overall, Vulkan is intended to give developers more control and flexibility over how they use the graphics hardware, which can lead to better performance and more efficient use of resources. This can be beneficial for developers creating applications for a wide range of platforms and devices, and it can also be beneficial for end users who want more performance from their applications.
