Question: ohms law I 'm getting into coil building for vapes and everyone says I need to understand ohms law and all I really know about it is how to spell it and it has something to do with resistance Explain like I'm five.

Answer: \nOhm's Law is a scientific principle that explains the relationship between electricity, resistance, and current. It is named after Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist who first described it in the 1800s.\n\nHere is a simple explanation of Ohm's Law:\n\nImagine you have a hose with water running through it. The water is like electricity, and the hose is like a wire. The wider the hose, the more water can flow through it at once. The narrower the hose, the less water can flow through it at the same time.\n\nIn the same way, the width of the wire (also called the cross-sectional area) affects how much electricity can flow through it. A wider wire allows more electricity to flow, while a narrower wire allows less electricity to flow.\n\nThe resistance of a wire is like the narrowness of the hose. The more resistance a wire has, the harder it is for electricity to flow through it.\n\nOhm's Law states that the current (the flow of electricity) in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage (the pressure of the electricity) and inversely proportional to the resistance. This means that if you increase the voltage, the current will also increase. On the other hand, if you increase the resistance, the current will decrease.\n\nHere is the mathematical formula for Ohm's Law:\n\nI = V/R\n\nWhere I is the current in amperes (A), V is the voltage in volts (V), and R is the resistance in ohms (Ω).\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
