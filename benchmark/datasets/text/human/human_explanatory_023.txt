Question: Why are graphing calculators so expensive ? And why is an ios app with the same functionality so cheap ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Texas Instruments has a near monopoly . Their whole Ti line of calculators uses the same shitty processor that has n't changed in 24 years . They have a significant investment in lobbyists who help write the law on public education and standardized testing , such that they made it so you ca n't use your cellphone or any other sort of digital device for calculating . You MUST use a form of single purpose device for calculating - a calculator . As though you could n't cheat . They 're programmable , and everyone loaded their memory with cheat sheets , even at the university level , where it 's trivial to get your hands on an answer sheet . That shit would spread around campus like wildfire . So since that 's the case , it 's no better than using your cellphone or laptop . Hell , in my state , the standardized tests and the teacher planners all specified a Ti-83 * * by name * * . And the schools bought enough calculators for every seat in the school . They came in these big plastic storage cases , like books . 8 to a case . We were never allowed to use them because A ) they 're expensive , and we 're kids and B ) the teachers ' attitudes were you should be doing it by hand so you learn something .
