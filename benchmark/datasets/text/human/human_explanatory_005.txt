Question: Explain to me like I 'm five what hair is and what are its main purposes . Human hair , facial , body , etc . Even nostrils , eyebrows , everything ! Explain like I'm five.

Answer: When you ask a question about the evolution of a trait , such as body hair , you have to understand that it may have no purpose at all . Granted , hair does have important qualities , but human hair is vestigial when compared to our mammal relatives . A vestigial trait or organ is one that no longer serves either it 's original purpose , or any purpose at all and it is lost over time . The few actual " purposes " left that hair serves include acting as a sentinel ( think of the feeling of an ant or a tick crawling on your arm ) , slight insulation on your head , and a cosmetic purpose as facial hair has become desirable to females . BumBeetle mentioned 2 of these purposes , but I though the cosmetic purpose was important to mention as well because sometimes a vestigial organ only remains because sexual selection ( selection by females generally ) acts to keep the trait around . Think of how peacock feather act as ornamentation , well , human facial hair can also be an ornament that helps us find a mate . Do you personally find people with no eyebrows , or hair on their head attractive ? Ornamentation matters too :)
