Question: How forums detect whether you 're still online or not ? You 've all stumbled on the forums that have a little online check box thing under the usernames . How do the forum sites detect whether they 're currently online ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Forum sites can detect whether a user is currently online by using a combination of server-side scripting and client-side technologies.On the server-side, the forum site can use a script to check whether a user is currently logged in. If the user is logged in, the server can update a database to reflect that the user is currently online.On the client-side, the forum site can use JavaScript to send a request to the server at regular intervals (e.g. every minute) to check whether the user is still logged in. If the server responds that the user is still logged in, the JavaScript code can update the online status on the forum page to show that the user is currently online.When a user logs out or closes their web browser, the server will no longer receive requests from the client-side JavaScript code, and can update the database to reflect that the user is no longer online.
