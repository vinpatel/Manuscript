Question: What happened to the economy the first time the government raised the minimum wage ? Did the economy perform poorly , better or no change ? Did employment fall or rise ? Did the number of people in poverty increase or decrease ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Looking at the first time might not do too much for us , maybe more interesting to see what happened when the states got free to set their own minimum wages as it creates a bit of a ideal laboratory for us . in between 1997 - 2007 the federal minimum wage did n't change but states fluctuated theirs and the overall consensus is that raising the minimum wage in no way leads to fewer jobs in the economy . You can read more about it in the study * " Why Does the Minimum Wage Have No Discernible Effect on Employment ? " , the Center for Economic and Policy Research * You can also read more about it from * " Minimum Wage Effects Across State Borders " , Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California , Berkeley * This study compared all neighboring counties in the U.S. located on different sides of a state border with different minimum wage levels between 1990 and 2006 and found no adverse employment effects from higher minimum wages . So we know that raising the minimum wage does not negatively affect employment , so what about the other stuff ? Well , raising the minimum wage generates several benefits , it has been shown to reduce staff turnover and it also increases the disposable income of low wage earners stimulating consumption . An added benefit is also that a lot of minimum wage earners will be able to get off government aid , this lessens the stress of state finances . * * DISCLAIMER * * This is a simplified view on a minimum wage increase , although not incorrect it is a complex issue and I urge anyone to take a in depth look on your own , ask questions and clarify opinions .
