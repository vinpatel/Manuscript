Question: Why is the standard paper 8.5 by 11 inches ? Why is regular paper those dimensions and not something more ... regular ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Outside of the US and Canada pretty much everywhere else on the world the standard paper size is the ISO A format with ISO A4 being the most used paper sheet . The format is about 8.2 by 11.6 inches , so it is n't that far off from the american standard . However , there is something you can do with the ISO standard that you ca n't with the american one : If you take a sheet of ISO A paper and cut it in half parallel to the short sides then you get 2 sheets that will still have the same proportions between their long and their short side as the original sheet had . As an example : Take the ISO A4 standard , which like i said is 8.2 by 11.6 inches or , to be more precise , 210 by 297 millimeters . The ratio between the sides is 210 / 297 = 0.7 ( rounded ) . Cut it in half and you get two sheets that are both 148 by 210 , and the ratio is 148 / 210 = 0.7 again . So out of a ISO A4 sheet you get two ISO A5 sheets if you cut it in half . Cut them in half again and you get four ISO A6 and so on . You ca n't do this with the american standard .
