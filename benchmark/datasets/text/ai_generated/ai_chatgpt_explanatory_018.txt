Question: What gives art its value ? What s stopping me from painting a blue square and selling it for thousands ? obviously i 'd get zilch but proper artists can get away with it ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Art has value because it is a way for people to express themselves and share their ideas, emotions, and experiences with others. It can also be a way for people to tell stories or convey messages. Some people are willing to pay a lot of money for art because they find it meaningful or because they enjoy looking at it. However, just painting a blue square and trying to sell it for thousands of dollars is not likely to be successful, because it does not have any inherent meaning or value to most people. In order for art to have value, it typically needs to be well-executed and have some sort of emotional or intellectual appeal to the viewer. Proper artists are able to create art that resonates with people and thus can sell their work for a high price.
