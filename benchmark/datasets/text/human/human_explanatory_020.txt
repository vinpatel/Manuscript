Question: If we can have 5 " 1080p displays why ca n't we have 20 " 8k displays ? This is definitely something I 've wondered for a while .. Explain like I'm five.

Answer: EDIT : Did n't know there really is a 8 K resolution . It is around 16X more dense than 1080 . But the following still applies . The resolution of a screen is the number of pixels wide by the number of pixels tall . Multiply those two numbers together and you get the total number of pixels a screen has . A common number of pixels for a 1080 screen is 2,073,600 . Each pixel requires information on what color it is supposed to be . You could have an 8 K display , but you would need a way to encode the information . You can see as the resolution goes up , so does the amount of information needed to display one frame . The amount of memory to do this grows rapidly . So if you had an 8 K screen , ( 4 K x 4 K ) that would be something like 16,000,000 pixels . About 8X more information to store , process and display than your typical 1080 . A hard drive would be needed to store that much information . I 'm not sure the biggest Blu - Ray disc could handle that much data . This requires a format to be developed for higher resolutions that most of the world can agree on and other things such as hardware to process this new multitude of data . You will also need to worry about the cabling and wires needed to transmit this information from devices to these 8 K screens . There are other concerns such as the time it would take to change all of those pixels to their appropriate color before the next frame is supposed to show . Remember , there are at least 16,000,000 pixels that need a tiny wire running to them ( probably 3 or more tiny wires ) to turn off and on . That 's a lot of switching to handle . tl : dr You probably can make a screen that size at that res , but it 's very difficult .
