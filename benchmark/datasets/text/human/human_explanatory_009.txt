Question: Libertarianism . The benefits , the drawbacks , all of it . And if you need to explain like I 'm 6 or 7 or 21 , go ahead . I just did n't know who else to ask . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: You 'll get 10 different answers from 10 different people on this one . But the overarching themes are that people should have maximum liberty with minimal suffering and coercion . Government should be restricted for this reason , as it seeks to limit liberty and take away from the individual . Some libertarians are for zero government ( anarcho - capitalists ) while others seek small government ( minarchists ) . There are many subtypes of libertarian , and many people disagree on what it means to be a true libertarian , but these core beliefs are pretty much standard . Edit : I realized I did n't answer part of your question . Benefits and drawbacks are subjective , but they can be summed up from a general standpoint . Benefits are that people are free to live their lives as they want to , without rules being imposed to excess by a government . Drawbacks that are frequently mentioned by opponents are that it 's harmful to the environment if no regulations exist , and that society will descend into chaos if the police / government does n't keep people in check . You can argue these points however .
