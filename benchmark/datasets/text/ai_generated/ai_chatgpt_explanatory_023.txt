Question: Why are graphing calculators so expensive ? And why is an ios app with the same functionality so cheap ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Graphing calculators are expensive for a few reasons. First, they are made with specialized hardware and software that is specifically designed to perform complex math tasks, like plotting graphs and solving equations. This hardware and software is more expensive to develop and produce than the hardware and software used in a smartphone or other device. Another reason graphing calculators are expensive is that they are often sold to students and schools, who may be willing to pay more for a high-quality calculator that will last for several years. In contrast, many smartphone apps are designed to be used for a shorter period of time and are often sold at a lower price to attract more users. Finally, the market for graphing calculators is relatively small, so the companies that make them don't have as much opportunity to sell their products and make a profit. This means that they have to charge more for each calculator to cover their costs and make a profit. I hope this helps to explain why graphing calculators are expensive!
