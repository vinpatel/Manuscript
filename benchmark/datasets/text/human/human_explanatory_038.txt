Question: How do astronomers know the size and distance of planets / stars / galaxies ? It always boggled my mind when they display the epic sized numbers when describing distances and size of space things ... Explain like I'm five.

Answer: There 's lots of different tricks scientists use to work this out , some were used more in olden times , and some use modern tools and techniques which have given us more accurate measurements and refined the measurements of astronomers in the past .... Triangulation , or the [ parallax method ] ( URL_2 ) was the first tool used for this , it 's pretty nifty and it is very simple considering what it can achieve . Now onto more distant stuff .... You know how when a police car zooms past you with it 's sirens blaring is sounds like it 's getting more high - pitched when it 's coming towards you and then getting lower again as it zooms off ? Well , the same thing happens with light ! we can use this little trick , along with the knowledge that the universe is expanding to look at the colour of a light source and if we know what colour it would be if it was stationary then we can tell how far away from us it is by seeing how much more in the red end of the colour spectrum it is , this is called [ red - shift . ] ( URL_3 ) We can use certain types of stars that twinkle in special ways , or are made of certain colours which mean that we know roughly what size they are and what they are made of , by using [ spectroscopy ] ( URL_1 ) . Therefore we use these [ ' standard candles ] ( URL_0 ) ' to work out the distances from us . Spectroscopy is very handy for working out what 's inside stars , and judging from their brightness , their distance away , and the colours they are producing we can get really accurate measurements to tell us what they are made of and how big they are . Hope that helps
