Question: What causes wind ? I checked out the Wikipedia article but require a little more extensive layman's / five year old explanation . I am curious ! Explain like I'm five.

Answer: Wind is caused by the movement of air. When the air around us is heated up, it rises into the sky and leaves a space behind it. The air around this space then rushes in to fill the empty space, which creates wind.

Imagine you have a big balloon filled with hot air. When you let go of the balloon, the hot air inside the balloon rises into the sky and the balloon starts to fly. The wind is like the hot air inside the balloon, and the balloon is like the Earth. When the air on the Earth gets hot, it rises up into the sky and leaves a space behind it. The air around this space then rushes in to fill the empty space, which creates wind.

So, to summarize, wind is caused by the movement of air as it tries to balance out the temperature around the Earth. When it's hot, the air rises and cool air rushes in to take its place, which creates wind.
