Question: What is Wall Street Explain ( like I 'm 5 ) what is walstreet ? And what is occupy walstreet ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: Wall Street is a famous street in New York with many Banks and trading places . The trading places do n't sell goods , they sell shares in big companies and shares in big deals , like oil . This is important to pay for big things , like whole ships full of oil to keep our cars going , and new businesses to create new jobs . Sometimes , things do n't work out - shares in a company get sold and then the company goes down , and the people who bought the shares loose their money and are very unhappy . Or someone borrows money from the bank where many people saved it , and looses it with a bad deal . The bank gets in trouble and needs to ask the government for money so people do n't loose their savings . But the people still have to pay , because they pay the taxes to help the bank , while the people who profited from the bad deals get to keep the money . Occupy Wall Street is a group of some people , who feel they have to do something against this , so they protest against and sometimes disturb banking and trading of this kind . They often think there are better solutions than allowing traders to do such deals , and they usually believe the government has to do more to control things , so that nothing bad happens . Many even want very big changes in the way money is handled , which puts them in conflict with governments and traders who say that the trading is necessary to keep things going well for us . So sometimes , they clash with police who try to keep them from disturbing the banks and trading places too much .
