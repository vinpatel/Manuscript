Question: How were movies edited before computers ? Computers have been around for a while but how were movies with special effects and FX sounds edited before computers ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: Before computers, movies were edited using film reels. A film reel is a long strip of film that contains the images and sounds that make up a movie. To edit a movie, the filmmakers would cut the film into pieces and then rearrange the pieces to create the final version of the movie.

To add special effects or sound effects to a movie, filmmakers would use a process called "stop motion." This involved taking a series of photographs of an object or character, making a change to it (such as adding a special effect), and then taking another series of photographs. When the photographs were played back in rapid succession, it would create the illusion of movement.

It was also possible to add sound to a movie by recording it onto a separate strip of film called a "soundtrack." The soundtrack would be played back alongside the images on the film reel to create the final version of the movie with sound.

Overall, editing movies before computers was a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that required a lot of skill and attention to detail. It is much easier and faster to edit movies using computers today.
