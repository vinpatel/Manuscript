Answer: Bollywood movies, which are produced in India, often feature musical numbers as a way to add entertainment value and to express emotions that may not be conveyed through dialogue alone. These musical numbers, which are called "songs," may be incorporated into the story as dream sequences, flashbacks, or as a way to advance the plot. In many Bollywood movies, the songs are often elaborately choreographed and may feature costumes and sets that are designed to add to the overall visual appeal of the film. While some Bollywood movies may be more serious in nature, it is common for these films to include both dramatic and comedic elements, and the inclusion of songs is often a way to balance out the more serious themes with lighter, more entertaining moments. Ultimately, the inclusion of songs in Bollywood movies is a long-standing tradition that is deeply ingrained in the culture of Indian cinema, and these musical numbers are often an important part of the overall appeal of these films.
