Question: How are we running out of antibiotics Just what goes into making them that we ca n't get anymore Explain like I'm five.

Answer: It is not that we are " running out " of antibiotics , it 's that the fact that the pathogens ( bacteria , fungi ) they are supposed to combat have become resistant to them . This is because people are given a course of antibiotics to treat whatever ailment they have . They start the course , feel better and then do not finish the course . Even though these people have relieved symptoms , they have not killed all of the bacteria / pathogens in their system . Those that survive , survive because they were more naturally resistant to the antibiotic than the other bacteria . It its these bacteria that go on to reproduce . This means that these bacteria have more resistance than the previous generation . After a period of about 70 years ( Antibiotics started being used during WWII ) this has become so bad that we now have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics ( eg . MRSA ) which is , of course , a bad thing . Doctors do not prescribe antibiotics so readily and we are now having to search for alternative therapies for a lot of diseases that used to be cured easily by antibiotics .
