Question: Binary search algorithm I ca n't understand this at all . ELI5 ? Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Sure! I'll do my best to explain binary search in a way that's easy to understand. Binary search is a way to find a specific item in a list of items. It's called "binary" because it uses a system of "yes or no" questions to narrow down the search, kind of like how a computer uses "1s and 0s" (which are called "bits") to do things. Here's how it works: 1. First, you need to have a sorted list of items. This is important because binary search only works on sorted lists. 2. Start by looking at the middle item in the list. 3. Ask yourself, "Is this the item I'm looking for?" If yes, great! You're done. If no, continue to step 4. 4. If the item you're looking for is smaller than the middle item, then you know it must be somewhere in the first half of the list. If the item you're looking for is larger than the middle item, then you know it must be somewhere in the second half of the list. 5. Pick one of the two halves of the list and repeat the process starting at step 2. Keep repeating this process until you find the item you're looking for, or until you realize that it's not in the list. I hope that helps! Do you have any questions about how it works?
