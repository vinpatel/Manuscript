Question: Why is the US falling behind the rest of the world in education ? What is causing this ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: There 's a few reasons , so we 'll look at one of the powerhouses of education : Korea . Oh boy . For a start , Koreas work really hard . They go to school 9 - 3 and then go to academies for another couple of hours then do their homework , then sleep . They do n't play school sports , and while some study music after school , in school , it 's all about learning . Imagine if American schools dropped their sports programs , think how much more time they 'd be to teach , and then how much more you 'd all learn if you had to study for a extra few hours in the evening too . Pretty hard to beat that work ethic . Then you have a lot of cultural reasons , Koreans are well behaved , so you get less disruptions in class . They have " tiger moms " who basically demand A 's or withhold love ( only sort of a joke ) . They are homogeneous , that is , most Koreans are Korean , so there 's no language barrier to education , and no cultural differences that make explanations difficult ... Finally , and potentially most importantly , the OCED uses PISA tests , which are for Maths , Science and Reading . Not for creative writing , not for debate , not for drama , and not for IT or business / economics . That 's not to say they 're wrong to test what they do , just that they only test what they see as important , not what a western education system might think is important .
