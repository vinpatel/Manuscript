Question: as someone from the UK , I have no idea why obamacare has been getting so much hate . explain . I really just have not clue . Explain like I'm five.

Answer: In general people do n't like it for several reasons : 1 . Congress passed the law and President Obama signed it without allowing the public to read the law . This is n't necessarily unprecedented but it riles folks up anyway . 2 . Congress passed the law using the reconciliation process . Normally an important bill needs at least 60 votes in the senate to pass , but the senate used a special process to pass the bill with 51 votes instead . It was a very shady , underhanded way to get the law passed . ( This is very ELI5 - there 's a lot more to it ) 3 . Many Americans are inherently distrustful of government , especially the federal government . It 's something that 's ingrained in our culture . Many of us do n't even trust the government to handle basic government services due to personal experiences , so trusting them with anything to do with something so intimate ( healthcare ) is not easy for Americans . 4 . For many people , especially small business owners who make a decent income , their existing plans were cancelled due to the new regulations , and the new healthcare plans that match the new regulations are often more costly . I 'm at work and out of time for the moment , but there are so many more reasons . It 's not 100 % bad , but it 's not the right solution .
