Question: Dark Matter What is it ? How does it work ? Why ca n't we directly affect it ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: Dark matter is a mysterious substance that scientists believe exists because of the way that galaxies behave. It doesn't give off any light, which is why it's called "dark," and it doesn't interact with regular matter in the same way that things like atoms do. Scientists believe that dark matter makes up a large portion of the universe, but we can't see it or touch it directly. We can only detect its presence by how it affects the way other objects move. One way scientists think dark matter might be able to affect things is by providing a kind of "gravitational glue" that holds galaxies together. Without dark matter, galaxies might fly apart because of the pull of gravity. We can't directly affect dark matter because it doesn't interact with regular matter in the same way. It's kind of like trying to catch a ball that's made out of rubber - no matter how hard you try, it just bounces off your hand. That's why it's so difficult for us to study dark matter - we can't directly observe it or experiment with it. But even though we don't fully understand dark matter yet, scientists are working hard to learn more about it and figure out its properties. Some scientists think that dark matter might be made up of particles we don't yet know about, and they're using superpowerful telescopes and other tools to try and find evidence of these particles.
