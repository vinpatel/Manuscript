Question: How does an anarcho - socialist society prevent a resurgence of capitalism , and how does an anarchist society in general prevent crime ? To me anarchy seems like a good idea in theory but has fundamental problems with implementation . Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: Well for one , under an anarcho - communist society ( more accurately ) , there should be economic equality , meaning the causes of a significant amount of crime , which are poverty - related , would go away , and thus a significant amount of crime would go away . Also , since drug prohibition would disappear , there would no longer be an illegal black market for drugs , which is a major cause of violent crime worldwide , with gangs and cartels fighting for territory , fighting against law enforcement , and killing civilians who get in the way or see something they were n't supposed to see . And finally , with true gender equality , it 's predicted that a significant amount of sexual assault and domestic violence would disappear too . So already , an anarchist society has abolished many of the root causes of crime . Then you have the ideas people have of so - called " restorative justice " which involve bringing the community together to discuss the perpetrator 's wrongs , asking them to explain themselves , make amends , and then ask forgiveness from the people they wronged . If a person is a repeat - offender and refuses to change their behavior or apologize for what they 've done , a sort - of de facto exile would happen when the community voluntarily disassociates from that person .
