Question: What happens to all the food that is n't sold before the best before date ? It ca n't all be thrown away ? Please explain like I'm five.

Answer: When food is not sold before the best before date, it is usually still safe to eat. The best before date is a guideline for how long the food will be at its best quality. It is not a safety date.However, if the food is not sold and is past the best before date, it may not be at its best quality anymore. The store or manufacturer may decide to donate the food to a food bank or other organization that can distribute it to people in need. Or, the food may be used for animal feed or compost.It is important to remember that food waste is a problem because it uses up resources like water, land, and energy to produce and transport the food, and it contributes to pollution. So, it is important to try to use up food before it goes past the best before date, and to donate or compost any food that is not used.
