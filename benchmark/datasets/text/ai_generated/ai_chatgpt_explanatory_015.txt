Question: How does my body " burn " calories to make food into energy ? I get what a calorie is , but how does my body use a small amount of food that we measure by its energy content into actual energy ? Explain like I'm five.

Answer: Sure! When you eat food, your body breaks down the molecules in the food into smaller pieces that it can use for energy. This process is called metabolism.

Your body needs a certain amount of energy to keep all of its systems running, like your heart beating, your lungs breathing, and your brain thinking. The energy that your body uses comes from the food that you eat.

Different types of food provide different amounts of energy. For example, a cookie might have a lot of energy (in the form of calories), while a carrot might have less. When you eat a cookie, your body breaks down the molecules in the cookie and turns them into energy that it can use right away.

So, when your body "burns" calories, it's really just using the energy from the food that you've eaten. The more active you are, the more energy your body needs, so it will "burn" more calories. Does that make sense?
