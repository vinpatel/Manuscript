Question: How is water managed and supplied in Trains ? You can use well explained technical terms and please talk about normal trains that are used for daily commute not the rather hi - tech ones ! Explain like I'm five. 

Answer: From a summer maintaining railcars : every individual car has a potable water tank for sinks and bars and blackwater tank for toilets . The Grey water ( soapy water or rinse water ) was fed in a drain system that emptied onto the track below . All of the cars were outfitted with valves on either end to hook up to a flexible food grade hose that would sit slack between the cars . We would have to bleach all fittings before hooking up hoses to the fill ports and when connecting two cars . There is another pump on each tank that allows for movement from one car to another in the event that one car ( or more ) ran out of water . Water would be pressurized throughout the railcar by activating a pump . All of these features were controlled on a switch board mounted on a door next to the entrance of the rail car that also controlled all light , generator usage , head end power Control ( half of the diesel electric generator on the engine is used to power up to ten rail cars . ) black water would be pumped out at the end of the day and all tanks would be filled with fresh water .
