Question: what is quantum internet and why is it so important ? everyone seems to be talking about it ... but ... what IS it ? ? also is it good or bad ? thank you :) Explain like I'm five.

Answer: Disclaimer ; I 'm answering this to the best of my shabby knowledge . Security is a big problem on the internet . When you do things like purchase items , you do n't want someone to steal your credit card number . So what we do is encrypt the sensitive information going through the internet . This means the information being sent is only viewable by the person sending it and the person receiving it . To everyone else it looks like garbage . Encryption usually relies on some secret information that either both people know , or sometimes only one person knows . These are referred to as the encryption keys . As I understand it , this is were quantum physics comes in . Because quantum physics is composed of magic and unicorn poop , it can teleport information from one place to another without the possibility of having it intercepted . ( Or if it is intercepted , we can find out . I 'm not quite clear on this . ) This means that we can either send information , or just the encryption keys , and be certain that no one will be able to discover what information was being sent . However , this does not mean the internet will suddenly become secure . There are other ways to get people 's secret information . For example , you could create a fake paypal website and trick people into giving them your credit card number anyway .
